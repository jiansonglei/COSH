# COSH
Outlier detection code for "CURE: Flexible Categorical Data Representation by Hierarchical Coupling Learning"
In the paper, we instantiate two instances of CURE framework: CDE and COSH.
CDE is used for majority-based tasks,such as clustering. CDE code is in another repository.
COSH is used for minority-based tasks, such as outlier detection.
COSH is especially effective for high-dimensional data.
